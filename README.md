Features
Level 1: Basic chatbot with hardcoded responses.
Level 2: Intelligent responses using OpenAI's generative AI models.
Level 3: Web-app deployed on AWS EC2 servers.
Level 3.5: Support for LLM-based responses through AWS Bedrock API.
Level 4: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for knowledge-based responses.
Level 4.5: LLM orchestration pattern with router and task-specific models for better contextual understanding.
Technologies
Next.js: A React framework for server-side rendering and building modern web apps.
OpenAI API: For accessing OpenAI’s generative AI models.
AWS EC2: For cloud deployment.
AWS Bedrock API: For integration with large language models (LLMs).
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): Enhances the chatbot by retrieving relevant data from a knowledge base.
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Node.js and npm installed
OpenAI API key
AWS account with EC2 setup
Basic knowledge of Next.js and server-side rendering
Setup and Installation
Clone the repository: ```bash git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-customer-support-chatbot.git cd ai-customer-support-chatbot ```

Install dependencies: ```bash npm install ```

Set up environment variables:

Create a .env.local file at the root of your project and add the following: ```bash OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-aws-access-key-id AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-aws-secret-access-key ```

Run the development server: ```bash npm run dev ```

Open http://localhost:3000 to view the app.

Usage
Once the application is running, users can interact with the chatbot by asking questions and receiving AI-generated responses in real-time.
The chatbot retrieves answers through OpenAI's API and intelligently handles requests based on implemented features.
Deployment
Deploy to AWS EC2:

Create an EC2 instance through your AWS account.
Configure the instance for hosting a Node.js application.
Deploy your project to the instance and configure a reverse proxy for the Next.js app.
Deployment on Vercel:

Alternatively, the project can be deployed on Vercel for easy hosting and continuous integration.
Simply push the project to GitHub and connect the repository to Vercel.
Levels of Implementation
This project follows a structured development plan:

Level 1: Create a chatbot with hardcoded responses for basic interactions.
Level 2: Leverage the OpenAI API to generate intelligent responses.
Level 3: Deploy the chatbot to AWS EC2.
Level 3.5: Respond using LLMs via AWS Bedrock API.
Level 4: Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to generate responses based on external knowledge bases.
Level 4.5: Create a flexible orchestration pattern using task-specific LLMs.
